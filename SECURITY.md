# Responsible disclosure policy

## Introduction

We take security very seriously at SDA SE.
We welcome any review of the latest release of all our open source code to ensure that these components can not be compromised.
In case you identified a security related issue with severity of _low_ to _medium_, please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/SDA-SE/cluster-scanner-orchestration). 


## Security related bugs with severity _high_ or _critical_

In case you identified a security related issue with severity of _high_ or _critical_, please disclose information about the issue non public via email to `opensource-security@sda.se`.

We encourage researchers to include a Proof-of-Concept, supported by screenshots or videos.
For each given security related issue with severity _high_ or _critical_ (based on SDA SE own assessment), we will respond within one week.
