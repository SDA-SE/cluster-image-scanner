# Scan Maleware (in development)
The malware scan makes sure that no malware has been introduced in the image. 
An Example: In case an adversary compromises a used third party component maintainer account of an image, the adversary can 
compromise the component. For example, a [cryptominer](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3253572/what-is-cryptojacking-how-to-prevent-detect-and-recover-from-it.html) can be introduced.

##  Relevance
The scanning of images for viruses is a mandatory process nowadays. Various possibilities of introducing viruses cannot be completely excluded, so it is only possible to scan the images with the help of virus scanners. One technique is described here as an example: It is possible that libraries are loaded from a wrong domain due to the so-called Typosquatting. Thus, an account on a website could be taken over undetected and an – at first glance correct – URL could be given, which at second glance might be different, but which in turn offers a library that is infected with a virus.

## Resolution
Use the following treatments on issues:

### Avoidance
If the virus scan for an image indicates that a virus was found, the image must be analysed for it, if after the assessment it is confirmed that it is a virus, the image must be deleted immediately and a new image must be created. Before the new image is build, it is thoroughly checked that the virus is not reintroduced into the image.

### Acceptance
Accepting a virus is not an option and will not be pursued further. A workaround must be found in any case.

### False Positive
If the result of the check is that the scan incorrectly reports a virus, then this scan will be marked as false positive.
